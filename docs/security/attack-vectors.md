# Attack Vectors

This document details potential attacks against the ZkSnap protocol and their mitigations.

## Vote Buying Attacks

### Direct Vote Buying

1. **Attack Description**
```plaintext
Method:
- Attacker offers payment for votes
- Requests proof of vote choice
- Attempts to verify compliance

Goal:
- Purchase specific votes
- Verify vote execution
- Influence outcome
```

2. **Protocol Defense**
```plaintext
Mitigations:
- Hidden vote contents
- Impossible to prove vote choice
- No vote-voter correlation
- Timelock encryption
```

### Vote Selling Schemes

1. **Attack Vectors**
```plaintext
Attempts:
- Voluntary vote selling
- Proof generation schemes
- Vote verification methods
```

2. **Prevention Mechanisms**
```plaintext
Defenses:
- No provable vote contents
- No verifiable voting proofs
- No timing correlation
```

## Privacy Attacks

### Correlation Attacks

1. **Methods**
```plaintext
Types:
- Timing analysis
- Network observation
- State monitoring
- Pattern matching
```

2. **Protocol Protection**
```plaintext
Measures:
- Encrypted communication
- Random delays
- Private key changes
- State privacy
```

### Identity Linking

1. **Attack Patterns**
```plaintext
Vectors:
- Public key analysis
- Nullifier correlation
- Transaction linking
- Timing correlation
```

2. **Mitigation Strategy**
```plaintext
Defenses:
- Key unlinkability
- Private nullifiers
- Timing obfuscation
```

## Protocol Attacks

### Double Voting

1. **Attack Mechanism**
```plaintext
Attempts:
- Multiple vote submission
- Nullifier manipulation
- State corruption
```

2. **Prevention**
```plaintext
Methods:
- Unique nullifiers
- State consistency checks
- Proof verification
```

### State Corruption

1. **Attack Vectors**
```plaintext
Types:
- Invalid state updates
- Merkle tree manipulation
- Nullifier set corruption
```

2. **Defense Mechanisms**
```plaintext
Protection:
- State verification
- Proof requirements
- Consistency checks
```

## Network Attacks

### Message Interception

1. **Attack Methods**
```plaintext
Vectors:
- Vote capture
- Proof interception
- State monitoring
```

2. **Mitigation**
```plaintext
Defenses:
- Encrypted communication
- Message authentication
- Replay protection
```
